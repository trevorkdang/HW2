# StudentRegression

## By: Trevor Dang

### This project models logistic regression to predict whether a student will be admitted to a university. It focuses on binary classification, where the outcome is either admission or no admission based on various student attributes.

## Implementation 

Implements the following to model logistic regression:
1. Compute the total cost by using cost function which uses a prediction from parameters w (weight) and b (bias)
2. Computes the gradient(slope) for logistic regression
3. Apply gradient descent to simulatneously update parameters w (weight) and b (bias) with a learning rate (alpha)
4. Produce predictions based on the given dataset
